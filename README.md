SensorThingsClient [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nsommer/SensorThingsClient.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nsommer/SensorThingsClient)
==================

This library provides a Java-based client library for the [SensorThingsAPI](https://github.com/opengeospatial/sensorthings) and aims to simplify development of SensorThings enabled client applications.

**Note:** This project is still under development and therefore lacks complete support of the SensorThingsAPI.

## Features

* CRUD operations
* Queries on entity sets
* Loading of referenced entities

## Unsupported

* Batch requests
* *$select*
* MultiDatastream
* dataArray
* MQTT

## API

The `SensorThingsService` class is central to the library. An instance of it represents a SensorThings service and is identified by an URI.

### CRUD operations

The source code below demonstrates the CRUD operations for Thing objects. Operations for other entities work similarly.

```java
URI serviceEndpoint = URI.create("http://example.org/v1.0/");
SensorThingsService service = new SensorThingsService(serviceEndpoint);
```

```java
Thing thing = new Thing();
thing.setDescription("I'm a thing!");
service.things().create(thing);

thing = service.things().find(1l);

thing.setDescription("Things change...");
service.things().update(thing);

service.things().delete(thing);
```

### Entity Sets

Entity Sets are represented by instances of `EntityList<>`. The query parameters specified by the SensorThingsAPI standard can be applied to queries.

```java
EntityList<Thing> things = service.things()
							.query()
							.count()
							.orderBy("description")
							.filter("")
							.skip(5)
							.top(10)
							.list();

for (Thing thing : things) {
	System.out.println("So many things!");
}
```

However, `$expand` does not work on queries yet.

### Loading referenced objects

Loading referenced objects in one operation (and therefore in one request) is supported. The *$expand* option of the SensorThingsAPI standard is used internally.

```java
Thing thing = service.things().find(1l,
				Expansion.of(EntityType.THING)
				.with(ExpandedEntity.from(EntityType.LOCATIONS)));
EntityList<Location> locations = thing.getLocations();
```

## Background

This library emerged from a practical work for a lecture at [KIT](http://www.kit.edu) in collaboration with the [Fraunhofer IOSB](http://iosb.fraunhofer.de). A [server implementation](https://github.com/FraunhoferIOSB/SensorThingsServer) of the SensorThingsAPI, developed by the Fraunhofer IOSB, is available on GitHub as well.
